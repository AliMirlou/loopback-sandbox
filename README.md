#loopback-sandbox

A repository for reproducing LoopBack community issues.

##Why

We would like to leverage community's support to respond quicker to fixing
issues. By providing us with the code and steps to reproduce, we can promptly
resolve these issues. As a benefit, we will give priority to issues that follow
our precribed procedure.

##Procedure

1. Submit a PR containing all the relevant code
2. In the PR message, please list the STR (steps to reproduce)
3. That's it! Wait for our comments in the PR itself and hopefully we'll get it
   resolved ASAP
