#loopback-sandbox

A repository for reproducing LoopBack community issues.

##Why

We would like to leverage community's support in order to improve our turnaround
times related to responding and fixing issues. By providing us with the code and
steps to reproduce the issue, we can promptly resolve the problems you run into.
As an added benefit, we will give priority to issues that follow our precribed
procedure listed below.

##Procedure

1. Submit a pull request (PR) containing all the relevant code
2. In the PR message, please list the steps to reproduce (STR)

We will then follow up by using the STR provided to prove the issue and respond
accordingly in the PR you created in step 2. We'll then fix the issue or let you
know what to do from there.
